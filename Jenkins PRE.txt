 sun microsystems by kawaguchi 

HUDSON(2004) known as JENKINS 2010 (Oracle). 2011

Jenkins known as a Heart/Core part of the DevOps.
 
1. Jenkins is an Open source project written in JAVA that runs on Windows, Linux, Mac-os.
2.Free to use and first choice for CI(Continouous integration) process.
3.It is java based application.
3.Consist plugins (Nothing but predefined software for automation process) SDLC.
4.SDLC means Software Development Life Cycle.
It is plugin based tool. nearly 1000+ plugins Jenkins will support.

Plugins are the primary means of enhancing the functionality of a Jenkins environment to suit organization- or user-specific needs. 
There are over a thousand different plugins which can be installed on a Jenkins controller and to integrate various 
build tools, cloud providers, analysis tools, and much more.

5. Whenever developers write code,we integrate all the code of developers at any point of time and we build, test,and deliver/deploy to client.
This is called as CI/CD.
6. Jenkins always run on 8080 port.(Default port )

Important section of Jenkins?

-Jenkins dashboard  ==> global configaratution ==> manage plugins ==> based on user specific needs install the plugins 
- plugin management
-global tool management.
-job management. 
-user management
-security management 
-slave connection.           3 to 5 interview qs 

Role of Devops Engineer (or)  Build and Release Engineer

-Installation and Configuration 
-plugin management
-creating jobs
-integrating different tools
-job pipelines 
-taking jenkins backup.  2 interview qs  



WORKFLOW:
 1. We can integrate/install Git,Maven,and Artifactory (JFROG/NEXUS) to the Jenkins.

Jenkins need to practice 
1. using wehooks 1 interview q
2.build periodically and e-mail notification  1 interview q 
3.build docker image and push ecr.

In jenkins ==> two types of pipelines

1. Declarative pipeline 2. Scriptive pipeline.
In this pipelines we will write groovy script.
Pipeline : pipeline is a code and it has set of stages and stages contains steps, steps will execute entire pipeline

stages example:

git clone url (git checkout)

build

deploy

===============================================================================================
steps step (gitcheckout)

git clone url

step (build)

mvn clean package

deploy

war file copy (by using scp)

Pipeline ===> Declarative   (file in github)
pipeline ===> node ===> scriptive pipeline   (write in jenkins dashboard)
agent:any, none, lable, docker
1. Declarative pipeline.

we will create Jenkinsfile in github.

pipeline {
agent any
stages{
stage (gitcheckout)
{
step (git clone url)
}
stage (build)
{
step (build)
mvn clean pakage
}
stage (deploy)
{
step ()
}
}

2.Scriptive pipeline ===> 
node {
agent any
stages{
stage (git checkout)
step ()
git clone url
}
stage (build)
{
step ()
mvn clean package
}
stage (deploy)
step ()
{
source destination
}
}




sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload


You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:

sudo systemctl enable jenkins
You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

sudo systemctl status jenkins
checking webkook process
again testing on webhook
